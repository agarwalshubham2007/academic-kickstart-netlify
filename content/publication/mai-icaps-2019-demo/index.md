abstract: The state of the art of dialogue agents requires a lengthy design process spanning months with experts in the loop who specify complex conversation patterns manually. Our work proposes a paradigm shift in bot design by adopting a declarative approach which composes the full dialog tree automatically. This allows the designer to construct complex dialogue agents from scratch and interact with them in a matter of hours. The demonstration will allow the audience to interact with this new design paradigm and construct their own bots on the spot.
