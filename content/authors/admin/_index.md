I am currently a [Research Software Engineer - AI](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Shubham.Agarwal) at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, MA](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/). My main interests lie in the intersection between AI, dialogue systems and planning.  Some of the projects I have completed include creating intelligent conversational agents, declarative dialogue design and execution systems, and automated time-series analytics (Award-winning project as Best Technical Demo at AAAI 2020).

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from **Arizona State University** in July 2017, where I worked on Natural Language Understanding and Semantic Parsing of English natural language (see thesis: “[Aligning English Sentences with Abstract Meaning Representation Graphs using Inductive Logic Programming](https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/189619/content/Agarwal_asu_0010N_17209.pdf) “).
