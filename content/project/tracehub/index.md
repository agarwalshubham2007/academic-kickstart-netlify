### Time-Series and TraceHub

* Time-Series - Series of observations ùë•_ùëñ, where each observation x corresponds to a specific time t
* TraceHub - Platform where separate analytics and dataset owners can plug in time-series analytics and datasets as APIs
* System runs semi-automated transformer pipelines to generate insights
* Reports usefulness of the generated insights

### Architecture

* **Data Loaders** : automatic type detection while loading the data as traces; each trace being sequence of events in time
* **Transformer Pipelines** : system automates the transformer pipeline by suggesting the applicable ones on the traces; comes with some standard out-of-the-box data transformers like one-hot encoding, missing value, quantiling, binarizing column etc.
* **Analytics** : after the transformer pipeline is completed, resulting output of traces is fed to analytics which then generates insights along with a usefulness score of it.

### Usecase ‚Äì Simulated Loan Application Dataset

* Loan application types : {medical, vacation, vehicle}
* Events in the application : {receive, evaluate, gather, decision}
  * *Receive* : new application submitted
  * *Evaluate* : agent evaluates the application
  * *Gather* : agent decides to gather additional documents for the application
  * *Decision* : agent approves or denies the application
* TraceHub generates insights on this data
* Code walk-through on below illustrating the 3 steps :
  * Data Loading
  * Transformer Pipelines
  * Insight generation

```
loader = TabularData()
data = loader.load(data_path="dataset.csv")
setoftraces = TraceSplit().split(data, "appid")

applicable_tfs = [tf for tf in transformers_list if tf.applicable(setoftraces)]
applicable_tfs[i].transform(setoftraces, *args)

analytics = applicable_tf_analytics(setoftraces)
analytics[i].apply(setoftraces)
```
