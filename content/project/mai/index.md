### Motivation

The motivation for goal oriented dialogue design is following:
* The designer must be in control of the behavior of the bot towards the end-users once it is deployed. This means that the specification of the bot must be interpretable to the designer, and also readily debuggable and editable as desired by the designer.
* The designer should be able to connect the bot’s actions to system functions or calls to API endpoints (e.g. to issue a ticket or place an order).
* Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in order to be able to support complex interaction patterns between the end-user and the bot, the bot designer must be able to completely describe the bot’s capabilities without having to manually specify the entire dialog tree.
